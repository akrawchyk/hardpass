/* hardpass

Problem:
Too many websites/applications have arbitrary and insecure password strength requirements.
Requirements are often inconvenient for the user with no added security benefit

Solution:
Library with configurable levels of safety, including sane and recommended defaults

1st: default minimum
smallest bundle size
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet#Password_Complexity
The password change mechanism should require a minimum level of complexity that makes sense for the application and its user population. For example:
* Password must meet at least 3 out of the following 4 complexity rules
  * at least 1 uppercase character (A-Z)
  * at least 1 lowercase character (a-z)
  * at least 1 digit (0-9)
  * at least 1 special character (punctuation) â€” do not forget to treat space as special characters too
  * at least 10 characters
  * at most 128 characters
  * not more than 2 identical characters in a row (e.g., 111 not allowed)
Make sure that every character the user types in is actually included in the password. We've seen systems that truncate the password at a length shorter than what the user provided (e.g., truncated at 15 characters when they entered 20).
As application's require more complex password policies, they need to be very clear about what these policies are. The required policy needs to be explicitly stated on the password change page
If the new password doesn't comply with the complexity policy, the error message should describe EVERY complexity rule that the new password does not comply with, not just the 1st rule it doesn't comply with.

2nd: extended dictionaries
these trade larger bundle size for more strict password checking

allow different lists to be combined?
use settings to drive bundling decisions
e.g. MIN_LENGTH = 8, remove all strings < length 8 from any extended dictionaries
extended checks:
these trade more network requests and more network time for more strict password checking
